            The Tellor Bounties program is a way to reward developers who help

                <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
                <p>
                  Scroll down to see available bounties, and see if anything
                  tickles your fancy and then shoot us an email to find out
                  more.
                  <br />
                  If it says yes, it's "available"! Then you can email us and
                  we'll say it's yours. If you want to help someone else working
                  on one not available, then also ask and we'll see if it's a fit.
                  <br />
                  If you're building something else that's open source and fits
                  with our mission...tell us to add it and let's keep building
                  this out.

                <h3>What this is NOT.</h3>
                <p>
                  This is not us paying teams to get this done. We're not
                  selling off our dev share or hiring contractors. Instead, we
                  want the community to become part of completing the network's
                  development need.
                  <br />
                  The rewards should be seen as just bonuses for helping to
                  build out Tellor, not necessarily a salary or a fair market
                  value for the work.
                  <br />
                  It's also not some anonymous thing. If you want the reward,
                  you have to let us know you're working on it. Hell, let
                  discord and the Tellor channel know you're on it. We want you
                  to work on it alone, with people, and with the team.
